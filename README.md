# python-message-encoder
A simple Python script that encodes and decodes messages by shifting characters and adding random padding
🔐 Python Message Encoder & Decoder

A beginner-friendly Python project that lets you encode and decode secret messages using simple transformations and random noise. Built using basic string manipulation and randomness — great for learning and fun!

✨ Features

Encodes each word by:

Moving the first letter to the end

Adding 3 random letters to the beginning and end

Reverses short words (less than 3 characters)

Decodes the message back to the original form

💠 How to Use

Run the project using any Python environment (like Jupyter Notebook or a Python IDE):

python message_encoder.py

Or open the message_encoder.ipynb notebook and run the cells.

You'll be prompted to enter a message. Example:

Input:

hello world

Encoded Output:

xwqellohzu jkeorldwfp

Decoded Output:

hello world
